# Actual CLI Surface (Commands & Purpose)

This document describes the primary commands available in the CLI, what they do, and common flags. Use this as a quick reference for automation or development.

The repository and product name are `better-ui`. The published npm package and executable are `better-ui-cli`.

Key commands (brief):

- The CLI is slash-only at the top level. Use `/scan`, `/doctor`, `/menu`, and similar forms.

- `scan` — Runs scanners across the project and produces a report.
  - Formats: `json` (default), `markdown`, `html` (`--format`)
  - Output: `--out <path>`; also writes snapshot to `.better-ui/history/latest.json`
  - Scope flags: `--changed`, `--staged` to limit to git diffs.
  - Advanced flags: `--skip-history`, `--top <n>`, `--scan-images`, `--open`

- `fix` — Applies autofixes or previews. Dry-run by default.
  - `--apply` to write ESLint autofixes to disk.
  - `--interactive` starts a hunk-level interactive selection flow.

- `health` — Builds a numeric health score and category summaries (uses `src/insights.ts`).

- `doctor` — Runs project readiness checks (config, scripts, typical pitfalls) and reports suggestions.

- `deps` — Finds unused dependencies and warns about known heavy frontend libraries.

- `advanced` — Shows the built-in cheat sheet for advanced flags, follow-up flows, and high-leverage commands.

- `check-accessibility` — Filters scan results to accessibility-related findings.

- `explain` — Converts raw findings into human-friendly why/fix/risk guidance (uses `src/explanations.ts`).

- `review` — Git-aware review flows. Common flags: `--changed`, `--staged`.

- `pr-summary` — Produces a PR-ready markdown summary of changed files and high-priority findings.

- `compare` — Compares current scan against last snapshot stored in `.better-ui/history`.

- `hotspots` — Outputs files ranked by combined severity/volume to help prioritize fixes.

- `images` — Scans images and can generate `.webp` variants. Use `--generate` to create webp files.

- `init` — Bootstraps `better-ui.config.json` and can inject `better-ui:*` scripts into `package.json`. Supports presets: `react`, `next`, `vite`, `vue`, `design-system`, `landing-page`, `typescript-library`.

- `tui` / `/menu` — Starts the interactive terminal UI (prompt-first command center, command palette, dashboards, review flows).

Slash aliases:

- The CLI supports slash-style aliases via `src/slashCommands.ts` and rejects non-slash top-level invocations.
- Every primary menu action in the TUI has a slash equivalent. The explicit aliases are: `/scan`, `/changed`, `/staged`, `/fix`, `/fix-preview`, `/fix-apply`, `/fix-interactive`, `/health`, `/doctor`, `/hotspots`, `/a11y`, `/review`, `/review-changed`, `/review-staged`, `/pr-summary`, `/compare`, `/deps`, `/explain`, `/images`, `/init`, `/advanced`, `/menu`, `/commands`, `/help`, and `/exit`.

Notes for automation and AI agents:

- The output formats are deterministic JSON/Markdown/HTML; automated consumers should prefer JSON for machine parsing.
- When applying fixes automatically, prefer creating a branch or making a reviewable PR. `fix --interactive` is safer because it limits writes to selected hunks.
