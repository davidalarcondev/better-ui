# Repository Instructions

This file defines the baseline contribution workflow for `better-ui`.

## Contribution sequence

1. Read `instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the relevant files in `docs/`.
2. Make the smallest correct change that solves the problem.
3. Run local verification before proposing the change.
4. Update documentation whenever behavior, workflows, or contributor expectations change.

## Required local verification

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

When relevant, also exercise the affected CLI flow directly:

```bash
npx ts-node src/cli.ts /commands
npx ts-node src/cli.ts /scan --format json --out tmp-report.json
```

## Documentation rules

- Functional changes must update `README.md`.
- Changes that add or reshape behavior must add or update a focused file under `docs/`.
- Contributor-process changes must update `CONTRIBUTING.md` or this file.

Additional requirement for new features:

- Any new user-facing functionality (CLI command, flag, TUI action, reporter, scanner behavior, etc.) MUST be documented in `README.md` with a short usage example and the key options. If the feature is substantial (more than a paragraph of explanation or with multiple steps to verify), a dedicated `docs/<descriptive-name>.md` file must be added describing: what the feature does, minimal commands to test it, considerations/limitations, and any required environment or system dependencies (for example, native libraries required by `sharp`).

- The author of the change must list in the PR/commit message which docs were updated (README.md and any new `docs/*.md`) and include the verification commands they ran.

## Product guardrails

- Keep the product local-first.
- Do not add outbound network behavior in product code without explicit review.
- Keep writes inside the project root using `src/projectPaths.ts`.
- Prefer dry-run or preview behavior before destructive or write-heavy flows.

## Open source bar

Changes should improve at least one of these:

- correctness
- maintainability
- contributor onboarding
- release confidence
- user trust in CLI output

## Change summary expectations

Any final change summary should include:

- what changed
- which docs were read and why
- which verification commands ran
- any known gaps or limitations
